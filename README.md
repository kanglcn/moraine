- We have notice many excellent open-source packages are rarely paid
  attention to due to lake of documentation. The package is developed
  with the [nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai/), a notebook-driven
  development platform. Developers only needs to simply write notebooks
  with lightweight markup and get high-quality documentation, tests,
  continuous integration, and packaging automatically.
